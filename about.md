👋🏼 I'm Seve. I live in New York with my wife and dog. I'm currently a Senior Product Manager at [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) leading our Developer Tools team. I enjoy writing about [personal style](https://sevedkim.com/dress-to-express.html), going hiking and backpacking, and actively practicing the art of [creation](https://sevedkim.com/less-consumption.html).
