In reflection of my past actions, my Less/More Principles speak to areas I've identified to improve on. I've found them to be much easier to remember and live out when they're simplified into Less X, More Y statements.

* Less waiting for help, More saving yourself
* Less title-chasing, More craftwork
* Less consumption, More creation
* Less planned, More spontaneous
* Less inside, More outdoors
* Less explaining, More evoking emotion
* Less guarded, More smiles
* Less complaining, More proposed solutions
* Less logistics, More stories
* Less brash, More diplomatic
* Less starting, More finishing
* Less multi-tasking, More uni-tasking
* Less excuses, More action
