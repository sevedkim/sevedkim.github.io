A [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) is essentially a manual for software projects. This is a manual for understanding my quirks and how I think we might work effectively together. I am more than open to change and welcome any feedback or suggestions!

**Principles**

- [First Principles Thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/) helps reduce bias and assumptions.
- Design for empowerment. Replace bottlenecks with self-service when possible and allow your users/customers to accomplish their goals with the least amount of friction.
- [Lead as a gardener, less as a chess player.](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/41976700-team-of-teams-new-rules-of-engagement-for-a-complex-world)

**My Role**

As the PM, it is my job to:

1. Empower the team by helping them understand the **WHO** & **WHY** we‚Äôre betting on an initiative
2. Say no to good opportunities so that we can say yes to great ones.

**Availability**

- Working Hours: M-F 10:00-18:00 EST
- Preferred Meeting Times: M-Th 11:00-15:00 EST
- Location/Timezone: New York, NY (EST)

**Communication**

I‚Äôd recommend the following Eisenhower Matrix for contacting me:

|  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Important | (e.g. Clients locked out of accounts) Zoom or Phone Call | (e.g. Request feedback on the latest spec) Slack DM tagged ‚ÄúNot Urgent‚Äù |
| Not Important | (e.g. Respond to a complaint email) Don‚Äôt let me be a bottleneck üôÉ | (e.g. Dank meme to share) Slack DM/Tweet |

I tend to favor asynchronous communications but understand it‚Äôs not always feasible.

- Face-to-face meetings are expensive and should have at least an objective for what we hope to reach by the end.
- My favorite type of meeting is what I call ‚Äújam sessions‚Äù. Allocated time for divergent exploration in a problem space. Think of this as visually collaborative brainstorming.
- Seeing is believing. I strongly believe seeing a mockup, diagram, or napkin doodle communicates far more effectively than without.

**Energy Boosters & Drainers**

Things that give me energy vs take it away
