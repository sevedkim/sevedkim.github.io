**Be kind**
People remember how you made them feel. Whether a grand or trivial gesture, kindness always improves the outcome. 

**Be present**
Ground your mind and body into this very moment. Time and energy are wasted unless it's fully focused on what's happening right now.

**What is the outcome?**
A goal is an end state and that end state. That end state needs to be understood before you make any moves.

**Take the path of most curiosity**
The best paths I've taken have been the ones that are driven by my intrinsic motivation.

**Teach others how to fish by fishing with them**
Empowerment of others comes not only from describing how, but showing up and being there with them.

**Here for a good, long time**
You can have both a good time and a long time. Make sure your decisions today consider both.

**Make space for feelings**
There's always a place for reason and logic, but that does not negate how we're feeling.

**Be firm with your boundaries**
If you don't set clear boundaries or thresholds, someone else will set them for you. 

**Consistent habits compound 10x**
Small behaviors invested thousands of times results in unimaginable return.
