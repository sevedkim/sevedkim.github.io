In the same ways that dating someone helps you get to know them, dating yourself can increase your self-awareness.

Dating yourself can be as simple as noticing what foods or drink you prefer. Taking note of what music or movie taste you have. Using mindfulness to gauge what experiences boost your energy vs take it away. For example, I noticed curiosity is a strong trait of mine. I leverage this in both my work in Product, understanding why users behave in certain ways, and writing, where I research a certain topic further.

Understanding this led to having more fulfilling work.

Be sure to be mindful of what is truly interesting, enjoyable and energizing to you. It is easy to be influenced to taking a certain career path because of your parent's expectations. Likewise, engaging in certain activities because that's what your friends have invited you to do.
